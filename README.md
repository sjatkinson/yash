# Yash - Yet Another Shell

This is a toy project used to learn zig.

I do hope to get a somewhat useable shell which supports pipes, redirection, job control,
and possibly other shell functionality. However, there is currently no intention of making
this into a daily use, or even special purpose use shell. The only purpose is to learn
zig on a project of sufficient size and complexity.
